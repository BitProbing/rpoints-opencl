C++ port of evil-knevil's python script to look for specific bitcoin private
keys.

This is a straight port of the py script to c++, using mpir for bit integer
support. It's possible there's a better or faster way to do this, but it
does provide a decent speed improvement on the python version.

This program works in conjunction with the server at
http://www.bitprobing.com/ - see that site, and the thread at
https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=433522.280
for more details.

Run it with 2 parameters. The first is your BTC address, the second is the
number of threads to run. Set this to the number of logical CPU cores you
have, if you want to get the best performance.

The code is somewhat slapdash, uncommented and not great quality. It was
something of a throw-it-together-quickly project. Sorry, Dijkstra.

C++ version written by gh2k, and your generous tips can be sent to
1gh2k13JzLTxDz2vmo8RH7HcjTLLg5kdc ;-)

The .sln is for Visual Studio 2012. The Makefile is for Linux.
Not tested on osx.

A Windows binary build is here:
https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/85325596/rpoints/rpoints.zip

This contains two versions, depending on whether you have an older or newer i7.
The 'noavx' exe should be used for older processors. If you're not sure, try
the faster one first, and the 'noavx' one if it crashes on startup.

It only works on 64-bit Windows, and needs the x64 redist from:
http://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/download/details.aspx?id=30679

To build on Linux: 
(only tested on ubuntu 12.04+ x64)

obviously:
apt-get install build-essential git-core

you need libgmp:
apt-get install libgmp-dev

You need clsocket:
apt-get install cmake
git clone https://github.com/DFHack/clsocket.git
cd clsocket
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/usr .
make
sudo make install

You should then be able to run 'make', to build.
